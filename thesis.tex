\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What is convection?}
\subsubsection{Convection in Astrophysics}
convection is very important in astrophysics
\subsubsection{Convection in Geophysics}
convection is very important in geophysics too!!! 
\subsubsection{Convection Somewhere Else}
And somewhere else for sure!!!

\section{Underlying Physics}
\subsection{Hydrodynamics}
\subsubsection{Derivation of the Equations of Ideal Hydrodynamics}
As all the most beautiful and successful laws of Physics, Hydrodynamics is derived from some conserved quantities, namely the \textbf{current density} $J^{\mu}$ and the \textbf{energy-momentum tensor} $T^{\mu \nu}$. These are nothing but the first and second momentum of the particle distribution function. Carrying out the calculation we would find: 


\[
  J= \frac{n(t,\vec{x})}{c}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    c \\
    \left< \dot{x} \right> \\
    \left< \dot{y} \right> \\
    \left< \dot{z} \right> \\
  \end{pmatrix}\quad
  T= \rho(t,\vec{x})
  \begin{pmatrix}
    c^2 \left< \gamma \right> & c \left< \gamma \dot{x} \right> &  c \left< \gamma \dot{y} \right> & c \left< \gamma \dot{z} \right> \\
     c \left< \gamma \dot{x} \right> & \left< \gamma \dot{x}^2 \right> &  \left< \gamma \dot{x}y \right> &  \left< \gamma \dot{x} \dot{z} \right>  \\
     c \left< \gamma \dot{y} \right> &  \left< \gamma \dot{y} \dot{x} \right>&  \left< \gamma \dot{y}^2 \right> &  \left< \gamma \dot{y} \dot{z} \right>  \\
     c \left< \gamma \dot{z} \right> &  \left< \gamma \dot{z}\dot{x} \right>& \left< \gamma \dot{z}\dot{y} \right> &  \left< \gamma \dot{z}^2 \right> 
  \end{pmatrix}
\]

where $n(t, \vec{x})$ is the number density, $c$ the speed of light,  $\left< a(t,\vec{x}) \right>$ means the average of the quantity $a$ over time and space in a neiborhood of $(t, \vec{x})$, $\gamma$ is the well known general relativistic parameter.
