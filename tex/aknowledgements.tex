At this point I need to thank my supervisor Fritz Röpke for welcoming me in the PSO group, suggesting such an interesting topic to me to work on and providing a powerful tool such as SLH. I need to thank every member of the group for creating such an inspiring and friendly atmosphere. When I walked into my office one year ago, I couldn't have expected any better. In particular I need to thank Philipp Edelmann who patiently introduced me in the computational universe and Samuel Jones for sharing his experience on the CBM problem.

I also feel I need to thank every member of the University of Heidelberg and of the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies who contributed over the past two years to my academic education.

Furthermore I need to thank the Jülich Supercomputing Center for providing part of the computational resources used for this work.
